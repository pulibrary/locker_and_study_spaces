Dear <%= @study_room_violation.name %>,
 
Today <%= @study_room_violation.number_of_books %> books were found in your study room area <%= @study_room_violation.location %> that were not checked out and we returned them to Circulation to be re-shelved. Please note that this is a serious violation of the study room agreement and that further violations may result in the termination of your study room assignment.
As a reminder, I have attached the study room agreement which is also posted at your study room.
<% if @study_room_violation.number_of_violations > 1 %>
This is the <%= @study_room_violation.number_of_violations.ordinalize %> occurrence.
<%end %>
If you have any questions, please contact me.

April Miller
