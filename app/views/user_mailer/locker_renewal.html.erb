<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Your locker privileges expire on <%= @assignment.expiration_date %>. If you would like to renew your locker, please email <a href="mailto:aprilm@princeton.edu">aprilm@princeton.edu</a>. Please remember if your status changes during the year from enrolled to on leave, in absentia or terminated, you will need to vacate your locker. (DCE and ETDCC graduate students are eligible for locker privileges.) </p>

<p>If you will not be renewing your locker, please let me know. I can make arrangements for your library materials to be returned.</p>

<p>Please contact me if you have any questions or problems. Thank you.</p>
 
<p>April Miller<br>
Supervisor, Library Access</p>
